Qs:
what are HTML Entities ? List out 5 Commonly used HTML entities.

ans:
HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a specific meaning in HTML or characters that are not easily typable on a keyboard. They begin with an ampersand (`&`) and end with a semicolon (`;`). Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

1. `&lt;` - Less than sign (<):
   - Represents the less than symbol ("<") and is used to display it in HTML without initiating a new HTML tag.

2. `&gt;` - Greater than sign (>):
   - Represents the greater than symbol (">") and is used to display it in HTML without closing an HTML tag.

3. `&amp;` - Ampersand (&):
   - Represents the ampersand symbol ("&") and is used to display it in HTML without starting an entity.

4. `&quot;` - Double quotation mark ("):
   - Represents the double quotation mark character, which is often used to denote attribute values in HTML.

5. `&copy;` - Copyright symbol (Â©):
   - Represents the copyright symbol and is used to display it in HTML.

These entities help ensure proper rendering of special characters and prevent conflicts with HTML syntax.
