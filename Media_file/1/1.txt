Qs :
List out the features of HTML5.

Ans : 
HTML5, the fifth and latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduced several new features and improvements over its predecessors. Here are some of the key features of HTML5:

1. **Semantics:** HTML5 includes new elements that provide better structure to web documents, making it easier for both browsers and developers to understand the content. Examples include `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<aside>`.

2. **Multimedia Support:** HTML5 provides native support for audio and video playback without the need for third-party plugins. The `<audio>` and `<video>` elements make it easy to embed media content directly into web pages.

3. **Canvas:** The `<canvas>` element allows dynamic rendering of graphics and images directly within the browser using JavaScript. This is particularly useful for creating interactive games and visualizations.

4. **Offline Web Applications:** HTML5 introduces the Application Cache (AppCache) feature, enabling web applications to work offline by caching resources. The `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs also provide client-side storage for web applications.

5. **Improved Forms:** HTML5 introduces new form input types, such as `<input type="email">`, `<input type="url">`, `<input type="tel">`, and more, making it easier to collect specific types of user input. The `<datalist>` element allows for creating autocomplete lists.

6. **Geolocation API:** HTML5 includes the Geolocation API, which enables web applications to access the user's geographical location information.

7. **Web Storage:** The `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs allow web applications to store data locally on the user's device, persisting even after the user closes the browser.

8. **Web Workers:** HTML5 introduces the concept of web workers, allowing developers to run scripts in the background, separate from the main browser thread. This enables parallel processing and improved performance for certain tasks.

9. **Web Sockets:** HTML5 supports Web Sockets, providing a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection, enhancing real-time communication between the client and server.

10. **Drag and Drop:** HTML5 enables native drag-and-drop functionality, making it easier to implement intuitive user interfaces for tasks like file uploads.

11. **Responsive Images:** HTML5 introduces the `<picture>` element and the `srcset` attribute, allowing developers to deliver different images based on the user's device capabilities and screen size, thereby improving performance and user experience.

12. **New API Support:** HTML5 includes various new APIs, such as the Canvas API, Web Storage API, Web Workers API, Geolocation API, and more, providing developers with powerful tools for creating interactive and feature-rich web applications.

These features collectively contribute to a more robust and dynamic web development environment. Keep in mind that browser support may vary for some features, and it's always a good practice to check compatibility before using specific HTML5 features in your projects.
